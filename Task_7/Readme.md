# **Task 7 – SPECKit Plus Summary & Concept Notes**

## **📌 What is SPECKit Plus? – Short Note**

**SPECKit Plus** is a structured framework designed to guide teams through building AI-native and software development projects in a clear, step-by-step manner. It provides five core phases—**Constitution, Specify, Plan, Tasks, and Implement**—each focusing on a different stage of transforming an idea into a working solution. The framework ensures clarity, collaboration, and consistent delivery by standardizing documentation, planning, execution, and iteration across all project stages.

## **📚 Short Answers for the 5 Core Concepts**

### **1️⃣ /constitution – Constitution Phase**

The **Constitution Phase** defines the foundation of the project. It focuses on the core purpose, vision, and scope of the idea. In this step, teams clearly document the problem, goals, constraints, and success metrics so everyone has a shared understanding before moving forward. It serves as the "project charter" that aligns all future decisions.

### **2️⃣ /specify – Specify Phase**

In the **Specify Phase**, the high-level idea is refined into detailed requirements. This includes defining features, user stories, system behaviour, acceptance criteria, and technical constraints. The goal is to remove ambiguity and translate vision into clear, testable specifications that guide development.

---

### **3️⃣ /plan – Plan Phase**

The **Plan Phase** focuses on organizing how the project will be executed. This includes breaking down requirements into actionable steps, selecting tools and technologies, estimating timelines, identifying dependencies, and creating a development roadmap. It ensures the team is prepared with a realistic and structured plan.

---

### **4️⃣ /tasks – Tasks Phase**

The **Tasks Phase** converts the plan into individual work items. Each task includes a clear description, expected output, difficulty level, priority, and assignment. This step makes the workflow manageable, trackable, and efficient. Tasks help ensure that progress is measurable and aligned with the project goals.

---

### **5️⃣ /implement – Implement Phase**

The **Implement Phase** is where the actual development happens. Teams execute tasks, write code, create deliverables, and continuously test and refine their work. This phase emphasizes building iteratively, reviewing progress, and ensuring every task meets the defined specifications and acceptance criteria.
